For cs102 project
Bookmate is an Android application which is initially designed to aid students in gathering books for their education and/or entertainment.
It has features enabling the students to lend their books to someone who previously put up an advert declaring his/her need for such books, without any payments.
Bookmate also serves as a shopping platform for academic sources. 
Rather than lending them, users are allowed to sell their course books or other academic books to others. 
Based on the purchases' quality, or the ease of the lending process, users are then given the opportunity to rate the sellers, based on a 5-star scale. 
Furthermore, this application not only serves as a shopping platform, it also has in-built chat rooms and groups for people with similar interests. 
This allows people to make new friends and adds a social aspect to the application.
